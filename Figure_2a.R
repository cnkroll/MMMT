# FIgure 3: Annual Duration Curves (DCs) from daily precipitation records
# Last Updated: August 2025

# Extending the MMMT temporal change detection tool to assess significant shifts 
# in diverse environmental variables, submitted to JAWRA August 2025.

# For this 2nd case study, daily precipitation data from the Global Historical Climatology Network Daily 
# (GHCN-D; https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search?datasetid=GHCND), compiled by 
# NOAAâ€™s National Centers for Environmental Information for Riverside, CA (USC00047470) are obtained for the period 1901 to 2023.

# To perform this analysis at another site, the user would need to change information in 
# the "Data Import" (line 68) and "Plotting" (line 128) sections of this script. In this 
# example, data from NOAA NCEI was downloaded and saved as a csv file, which was 
# read into R. See "Precipitation_Riverside.csv" for file structure and column headings.

# yr1_1/yr1_2 = year of the first day of data1/data2
# yrn_1/yrn_2 = year of the last day of data1/data2
# ex = T/F flag where T = x-axis plots exceedance probabilities (1-cdf) and F = axis plots cdfs
# logy = T/F flag where when T = y-axis is plotted on a log scale and F = y-axis is not plotted on a log scale
# FDR_flag = result of the field/global significance using a multiple False Discovery Rate (FDR) Test
# FDR_In = T/F flag where when T = FDR test results are plotted on figure and F = FDR test results are not plotted on figure
# pvalueflag_In = T/F flag where when T = Median Annual Percent zero are plotted on figure and F = Median Annual Percent zero are not plotted on figure
# yaxis_custom = T/F flag where when T = user can customize the step size of the y-axis, F= keeps the original axis logic exactly as is in the plot function
# ymin = minimum value on y axis
# ymax = maximum value on y axis
# y_steps = Step size to customize the y-axis
